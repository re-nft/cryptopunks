                    We leverage the offerpunktoaddress function within the
                    Cryptopunks contract to avoid smart contract risk. The
                    protocol requires a minimum value of Eth that is an order of
                    magnitude more than all Eth in existence which ensures it is
                    impossible for someone to actually accept the offer.

                    By adopting the protocol below, Cryptopunk owners who lease
                    their punks are agreeing to the following terms
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    1.&nbsp;Tenants may display as avatar their rented punk on
                    Twitter, Discord, NFT marketplaces and any other social
                    platform where punk users congregate.
                    <br />
                    2.&nbsp;Cryptopunk owners will refrain from using their own
                    punk on these platforms while a tenant has rights to a punk
                    <br />
                    3.&nbsp;Cryptopunk owners agree to not sell or offer for
                    sale any punk to which a tenant has rights.
                    <br />
                    4.&nbsp;Upon expiration, tenants agree to proactively remove
                    their rented punk from platforms.
                    <br />
                    5.&nbsp;Our protocol does not prevent an owner from selling
                    a punk under lease. Prospective buyers are instead asked to
                    be aware of tenant rights. In the unfortunate event of a
                    sale while a tenant has rights, those who adopt this
                    protocol commit to siding with the tenant, This means
                    tenants retain their rights until their term expires. Buyers
                    should be aware that attempting to resell a punk with
                    current tenant rights may diminish their resale prospects
                    until the tenant term expires.

                    We believe there is an authentic experience of having an NFT
                    that is different than just looking at it. This extends to
                    tenant rights. If you have bought any NFTs, you probably
                    understand this.The most prominent punks probably serve as a
                    great example:  If Perugia used the protocol to gift you
                    tenant rights for a month to his alien, would you feel
                    honored? Keep in mind that for all time the provenance of
                    this gift is on chain. Would you use it as your Avatar? Punk
                    owners that have never had a zombie ape or alien should
                    probably see the instant appeal here. Now extrapolate from
                    there. For many people a Cryptopunk is too expensive to
                    justify owning one, with their current finances. Would they
                    not feel honored to have one temporarily ?

                    One does not simply give a cryptopunk in 2021. They could.
                    But It’s a very expensive gift. Tenant rights allow more
                    people to experience of having a cryptopunk, that may not
                    otherwise be able to afford one.

                    The on chain transaction proves owner intent to use this

                    As tenant, your Ethereum address is forever embedded in this
                    particular cryptopunk’s history, and anyone who understands
                    this protocol will know that an owner gave your ethereum

                  <dd className="mt-2 text-base text-gray-500">
                    The best way to accomplish this is to wait for tenant rights
                    to expire and then giift them for an additional 99 days. The
                    protocol only reads the first 2 digits following protocol
                    version 0.

                    Why can’t I gift tenant rights for longer than 99 days?

                  <dd className="mt-2 text-base text-gray-500">
                    This rule is to protect tenants and owners from a prolonged
                    state of limbo. If an owner gifted tenant rights and then
                    sold the punk to an unsuspecting buyer, there could be a
                    dispute who actually had rights to display the punk as
                    avatar. By protocol design, we are calling on the community
                    to side with tenant rights until they expire. But this is a
                    strange state where a new punk owner who does not
                    technically have full access to punk rights for a period of
                    time. We believe that in the vast majority of cases punk
                    owner integrity will prevent a state of limbo, but the 99
                    day limit ensures any potential limbo will be resolved in
                    months rather than years. This guarantees the long term
                    ownership integrity of each punk.

                    Why should a punk owner acknowledge the tenant rights given

                  <dd className="mt-2 text-base text-gray-500">
                    Ideally a prospective buyer would not buy a punk with
                    existing tenant rights because a sale violates the agreement
                    of using this protocol. It is possible however that a buyer
                    may purchase a punk under this scenario without knowing the
                    gift existed. We believe it is in the community&nbsp;s
                    interest to acknowledge and respect tenant rights, and to
                    inform perspective buyers if a punk previously gifted is
                    offered for sale before expiration.
