## Spec

### Protocol Spec

We propose to construct the `minSalePriceInWei` argument in the `offerPunkForSaleToAddress` and `offerPunkForSale` in a particular way to be able to achieve the `v0` Cryptopunk gifting feature. Find below the explanation

![protocol-spec](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/750048504377770104/830171125836414999/photo_2021-04-09_21-00-37.jpg)

1. `ff` is to ensure noone can accept the bid. These two hex characters at the front ensure that the number we end up with is at least:
`115339776388732929035197660848497720713218148788040405586178452820382218977280`
that is how much someone would have to pay to accept the offer
you can verify this here
https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html
by inputting
`0xff00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
2. `8e` is the checksum. This is to ensure that during the price transmission no data was lost in a message. Standard computer science trick
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum#:~:text=A%20checksum%20is%20a%20small,upon%20to%20verify%20data%20authenticity.
3. `00` is the protocol version. This will help people correctly parse the messages we send. It is conceivable that extension of the gifting protocol will require new data to be specified. Such as the rent price. This new data, will be packed into all or some of the remaining `54` hexbytes we have left. Therefore, developers will be able to say: "oh, this is version `00` so I know I have to parse it as per the spec here"
this will be incremented `+1` on each new version release, obviously
4. `000e` is the lease length. e in hexadecimal is `14`, denoting days

### Frontend Spec

- Filtering in Cryptopunks
  - **requires filters**
  - view all cryptopunks gifted (superset of the below)
  - view cryptopunks gifted to me (subset of the above)
  - view cryptopunks I gifted (subset of all, by definition lol)
  - under each punk view extra info (current owner, current tenant, tenancy dates)
- Click on a punk, modal window opens
  - **requires subgraph**
  - details on a punk
  - owner
  - tenant
  - tenancy dates
  - provenance history
  - *if owner*: lend the punk (created the offer to address or plain offer to as per protocol)
- FAQ
  - section about how it works
  - section about responsibilities of the renter and the lender

- Optional
  - little notes section for yourself, to remind you where you have used the cryptopunks
    this is useful for when the renting period ends to remind you where you need to take it off
  - email notification for when the due date is coming up
  - ability to view lender's address
  - filtering / sorting
  - highly useful. API to change all / some of your social avatars with the cryptopunk you have just rented out. Likewise, enable unsetting. (we can do this super easily with Next.js)
  - only owner can change details about the punk. When clicking on a punk, show the punk's provenance + owners' details. (plural)

- Future
  - view cryptopunks available for rent
  - web3 call to og crypto punks. create bid. 4 1s. This will accept tenancy rights.

### Services

- subgraph
  - pull all cryptopunks currently gifted to someone
- pull all cryptopunks (there is an image). There should be an API, too

### Communications

- renft cryptopunk leasing support channel?
